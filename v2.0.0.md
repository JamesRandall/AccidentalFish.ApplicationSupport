# v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Documentation

* Improved API documentation

## Queues

* Added the _Task ExtendLeaseAsync(IQueueItem<T> queueItem)_ method to IAsynchronousQueue
* The Azure brokered message queue implementation of the IAsynchronousQueue method _Task ExtendLeaseAsync(IQueueItem<T> queueItem, TimeSpan visibilityTimeout)_ now throws a NotSupportedException due to the Service Bus lack of implementation of a per extension visibility timeout (it extends by the fixed visibility on the queue definition).
* The Azure brokered message queue implementation of the IQueue method _void ExtendLease(IQueueItem<T> queueItem, TimeSpan visibilityTimeout)_ now throws a NotSupportedException due to the Service Bus lack of implementation of a per extension visibility timeout (it extends by the fixed visibility on the queue definition).
* Removed the Create*BrokeredMessageQueue methods from IQueueFactory as they were their only to support mutliple vendor provided variants (Azure). Their is now an IAzureQueueFactory that derives from IQueueFactory and implements these methods.
* Removed the Get*BrokeredMessageQueue methods from IApplicationResourceFactory and added them to IAzureApplicationResourceFactory.

## Unit Of Work and Repository Pattern

* Renamed OptimisticRepositoryWinsUpdate to OptimisticRepositoryWinsUpdateAsync
* Moved the ExecuteAsync and SuspectExecutionPolicy methods from IUnitOfWorkAsync to IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWorkAsync as they are implementation specific
* Moved the Execute and SuspectExecutionPolicy methods from IUnitOfWork to IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork as they are implementation specific
* IEntityFrameWorkUnitOfWorkAsync and IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork interfaces can be obtained by casting the IUnitOfWorkAsync and IUnitOfWork interfaces returned from constructors when the EntityFramework repository NuGet package is being used. In practice the functionality now on these interfaces has been used rarely and so this feels the right way to do this (rather than burdening with more construction methods across the system).
* The GetRepositoryAsync method of IUnitOfWorkAsync has been deprecated and will be removed in the next verison. GetRepository should be used instead.

## Logger

* The Logger method on ILoggerExtension has been renamed to BeforeLog and this now returns a boolean giving the extension an oppurtunity to prevent the logger from actually logging the item
