# v2.0.0 Release Notes

## General

* API documentation for the Core assembly
* Adopted C# 6 conventions

## Startup

* Existing _RegisterDependencies()_ approach to startup is replaced by a fluent _.UseX_ API. _RegisterDependencies_ has been marked Obsolete and will be removed in the next major update.

## Queues

* Added the _Task ExtendLeaseAsync(IQueueItem<T> queueItem)_ method to IAsynchronousQueue
* The Azure brokered message queue implementation of the IAsynchronousQueue method _Task ExtendLeaseAsync(IQueueItem<T> queueItem, TimeSpan visibilityTimeout)_ now throws a NotSupportedException due to the Service Bus lack of implementation of a per extension visibility timeout (it extends by the fixed visibility on the queue definition).
* The Azure brokered message queue implementation of the IQueue method _void ExtendLease(IQueueItem<T> queueItem, TimeSpan visibilityTimeout)_ now throws a NotSupportedException due to the Service Bus lack of implementation of a per extension visibility timeout (it extends by the fixed visibility on the queue definition).
* Removed the _Create*BrokeredMessageQueue_ methods from IQueueFactory as they were their only to support mutliple vendor provided variants (Azure). Their is now an IAzureQueueFactory that derives from IQueueFactory and implements these methods.
* Removed the _Get*BrokeredMessageQueue_ methods from IApplicationResourceFactory and added them to IAzureApplicationResourceFactory.
* Renamed _Receive_ to _ReceiveAsync_ on IAsynchronousSubscription

## Topics and Subscriptions

* Added the _GetAsyncSubscription<T>(string subscriptionName, string topicName, IComponentIdentity componentIdentity)_ method to the application resource factory

## Unit Of Work and Repository Pattern

* Renamed _OptimisticRepositoryWinsUpdate_ to _OptimisticRepositoryWinsUpdateAsync_
* Moved the _ExecuteAsync_ and _SuspendExecutionPolicy_ methods from IUnitOfWorkAsync to IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWorkAsync as they are implementation specific
* Moved the _Execute_ and _SuspendExecutionPolicy_ methods from IUnitOfWork to IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork as they are implementation specific
* IEntityFrameWorkUnitOfWorkAsync and IEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork interfaces can be obtained by casting the IUnitOfWorkAsync and IUnitOfWork interfaces returned from constructors when the EntityFramework repository NuGet package is being used. In practice the functionality now on these interfaces has been used rarely and so this feels the right way to do this (rather than burdening with more construction methods across the system).
* The _GetRepositoryAsync_ method of IUnitOfWorkAsync has been deprecated and will be removed in the next verison. GetRepository should be used instead.
* The _Find_ method on IRepository and IRepositoryAsync has had it's signature changed from _T Find(int id)_ to _T Find(object id)_
* Added _void Delete(T entity)_ to IRepository
* The _Task<bool> OptimisticRepositoryWinsUpdateAsync(Action update)_ method on IRepositoryAsync no longer returns a bool as it's return signifies success (it will always have returned true in the past)

## Email

* All _Send_ methods on IEmailManager now renamed to _SendAsync_
* IEmailManager is now obsolete and will be removed in the next major version - there is an equivelant IEmailQueueDispatcher introduced as a replacement
* The _Send_ method on IEMailProvider has been renamed to _SendAsync_

## Alerts

* Renamed the _Send_ method of IAlertSender to SendAsync

## Backoff Processors

* Renamed _Start_ to _StartAsync_ on BackoffQueueProcessor and BackoffSubscriptionProcessor
* Renamed _HandleRecievedItem_ to _HandleRecievedItemAsync_ on BackoffQueueProcessor and BackoffSubscriptionProcessor

## Runtime and Hostable components

* The _Start_ method has been renamed to _StartAsync_ on IHostableComponent
* The _Start_ method on IComponentHost has been renamed to _StartAsync_
* The _GetConfiguration_ method on IComponentHost has been renamed to _GetConfigurationAsync_

## Blobs

* The non-async blob methods on IAsynchronousBlockBlobRepository are now obsolete and will be removed on the next major version

## Policies

* ILeaseManager moved from the namespace AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Core.NoSql to AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Core.Policies
* The _Execute_ methods on IAsynchronousBackoffPolicy have been renamed to _ExecuteAsync_
* All the _Retry_ methods on ILeasedRetry have had Async added as a postfix
* All methods on ILeaseManager have had Async added as a postfix
* Renamed _CreateIfNotExists_ to _CreateIfNotExistsAsync_ on IResourceCreator

## Logger

* The _Logger_ method on ILoggerExtension has been renamed to _BeforeLog_ and this now returns a boolean giving the extension an oppurtunity to prevent the logger from actually logging the item.
* All methods on ILogger have been postfixed with Async (so Debug becomes DebugAsync)

## Bug Fixes

* Azure non-async blob implementations now correctly non-async.
* Legacy queue serializer fix for exception in reader
