	"body":"### Welcome to AccidentalFish Application Support\r\nThis project is a lightweight framework that provides a set of common application development patterns as a set of dependency injectable components. It is built to support a continual delivery / automated deployment approach to development through it's configuration and settings systems. Although a lot of the patterns are abstract some of the implementations (queues, topics, subscriptions and table storage) are only available as Azure implementations.\r\n\r\nThe framework is in use in numerous projects and continues to evolve as it is in active development.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nThe easiest way to get started is to install the NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nPackage|Description\r\n-------|-----------\r\n[Azure PaaS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Azure/)|Azure queue, table storage, topic and subscription implementations\r\n[Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Core/)|The core library - defines many of the frameworks interfaces and some of the dependency free implementation\r\n[Abstract Dependency Resolver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.DependencyResolver/)|Buffers the framework from a specific dependency injector\r\n[Amazon SES Email Provider](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Email.Amazon/)|Amazon SES email implementation for use with the email templating and dispatch system\r\n[SendGrid Email Provider](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Email.SendGrid/)|SendGrid email implementation for use with the email templating and dispatch system\r\n[Application Insights Logger](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Logging.ApplicationInsights/)|Extends the built in logger to push warnings and errors to Azure Application Insights\r\n[Powershell Cmdlets](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Powershell/)|Powershell cmdlets for supporting configuration and a continual delivery / automated deployment system\r\n[Background Processes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Processes/)|Email dispatch and log queue processing\r\n[Entity Framework Repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Repository.EntityFramework/)|Entity Framework implementation of the unit of work and repository pattern defined in the core package\r\n[Unity Dependency Resolver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Unity/)|Unity implementation of the dependency resolver\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI'm currently having a bit of a documentation push and it should start to appear here over the coming weeks.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're having trouble or think you've found a bug then the best place to get in touch is through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JamesRandall/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport/issues) and I occasionally post on my blog [Azure From The Trenches](https://www.azurefromthetrenches.com) about it.",
