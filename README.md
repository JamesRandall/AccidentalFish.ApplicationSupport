AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport
=================================

**v3.0.0 Released** - see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/JamesRandall/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport/blob/master/ReleaseNotes/v3.0.0.md), [Documentation](http://jamesrandall.github.io/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport/) and [API Reference](http://jamesrandall.github.io/docs/accidentalfish.applicationsupport/)

As I've worked on a variety of Azure projects over the last 18 months there is a bunch of plumbing I've found to be common for example wanting dependency injectable patterns for resource access, configuring components across multiple projects and servers, deployment, separation of concerns, fault diagnosis and a management dashboard, to name just a few.

The AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport framework is my attempt to bring solutions to these common requirements into a reusable package in order to bootstrap my own, and hopefully others, work.

[Documentation](http://jamesrandall.github.io/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport/) is beginning to appear on the projects [GitHub Pages](http://jamesrandall.github.io/AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport/) website.

It's covered by the permissive MIT License so is free to use in open source and commercial applications.

Going forwards I expect to make reference to this framework from my [Azure From The Trenches blog](http://www.azurefromthetrenches.com) and it forms part of the companion project I am readying for that site.
