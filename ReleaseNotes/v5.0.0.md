# v5.0.0 Release Notes

### Asynchronous Factories and Configuration

* Support for asynchronous and lazy resource provider creation
* Support for asynchronous application setting providers
* Added a Windows Console App equivelant for Set-KeyVaultSecrets

### Obsolete

* The IKeyVaultConfiguration class has been marked obsolete and will be removed in a future version. Using key vault in situations where you can't do "async all the way down" is dangerous with a high risk of dead lock without an awful lot of care. The preferred approach going forwards is the asynchronous support resource factories and settings added in this version.
