# v4.0.0 Release Notes

### Key Vault support

Support has been added for using key vault to provide runtime component configuration settings. Use the UseKeyVault() extension method on the dependency resolver in the Azure assembly to enable this.

Secrets that should be stored in and fetched from the keyvault should be marked with the is-secret attribute in the settings file and this will cause any string they are merged into to be stored in a key vault.

To populate a key vault a new cmdlet has been introduced called Set-KeyVaultSecrets. This takes a configuration and settings file along with key vault connection settings and will set any secrets in the vault.
