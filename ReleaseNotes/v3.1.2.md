# v3.1.2 Release Notes

This release contains an urgent bug fix. The entity framework unit of work was verbosely logging and including the connection string.
Because the connection string is accessed before the connection is opened the password has not been removed by ADO.Net.
This fix replaces the connection string with the context type.

Release 3.1.1 was pulled as it was an attempt to mask the password before I started to worry about the vagaries and multitude of formats of connection strings)

## Bug Fixes

* Verbose logging for Entity Framework unit of work now includes context type rather than connection string.
