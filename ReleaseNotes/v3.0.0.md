# v3.0.0 Release Notes

This release is focussed on improving logging capabilities and adding support for robust logging solutions with out the box support for my favourite (Serilog).
The existing queue based logger continues to be supported though is now in a separate NuGet package (AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Logging.QueueLogger) and in addition
support has been added for Serilog in the new AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Logging.Serilog package.

## Improvements

* All NuGet dependencies have been updated to the latest versions
* Stub implementations have been included in the core package for the lease manager factory, blob repository factory and queue factory allowing the framework to be used without underlying implementations for these components.
* The logging system has been completely overhauled:
	* ILogger interface has new methods for Verbose and Fatal
	* ILogger interface async methods now have async postfixed to the method name
	* ILoggerExtension is renamed IQueueLoggerExtension and has been moved to this package
	* ILoggerFactory has been massively simplified
	* The UseCore startup method no longer takes a logger type, instead it now defaults to a console logger and can be changed by a UseX method on a logger package.
	* The UseCore startup method no longer takes a loggerExtenstion type, this now forms part of the QueueLogger package
	* The default minimum log level can now be set at the log factory level
	* Support included for Serilog in an optional Nuget package
* Methods marked [Obsolete] in the 2.x series have been removed.
