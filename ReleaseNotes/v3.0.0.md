# v3.0.0 Release Notes

This release is focussed on improving logging capabilities and adding support for robust logging solutions with initial out the box support for my favourite (Serilog).
The existing queue based logger continues to be supported though is now in a separate NuGet package (AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Logging.QueueLogger) and in addition
support has been added for Serilog in the new AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Logging.Serilog package.

To simplify code the use of the ILoggerFactory interface is no longer required for simple log access - the ILogger interface can be injected directly. ILoggerFactory
remains available for more complex or specific log configuration.

## Improvements

* All NuGet dependencies have been updated to the latest versions
* Dependency resolver interface now supports a fluent style of registration
* The abstract dependency resolver now supports deferred resolution
* Stub implementations have been included in the core package for the lease manager factory, blob repository factory and queue factory allowing the framework to be used without underlying implementations for these components.
* The logging system has been completely overhauled:
	* The ILogger interface is now directly injectable if a logger with the default configuration is required
	* The default framework logger not outputs to Trace
	* The console logger has been moved into an optional NuGet package.
	* The queue logger has been moved into an optional NuGet package.
	* The old ILogger interface has been renamed IAsynchronousLogger
	* IAsynchronousLogger interface has new methods for Verbose and Fatal
	* IAsynchronousLogger interface async methods now have async postfixed to the method name
	* A new syncrhonous ILogger interface has been introduced
	* All ILogger and IAsynchronousLogger methods now have optional object[] params to enable additional data to be supplied to loggers that support this such as SeriLog
	* ILoggerExtension is renamed IQueueLoggerExtension and has been moved to this package
	* ILoggerFactory has been massively simplified
	* The UseCore startup method no longer takes a logger type, instead it now defaults to a console logger and can be changed by a UseX method on a logger package.
	* The UseCore startup method no longer takes a loggerExtenstion type, this now forms part of the QueueLogger package and the UseQueueLoggerMethod
	* The default minimum log level can now be set when configuring a logger package e.g. resolver.UseSerilog(defaultMinimumLogLevel = LogLevelEnum.Verbose)
	* The default component source can now be set when configuring a logger package e.g. resolver.UseSerilog(defaultLoggerSource = new LoggerSource("Some.Component"))
	* Support included for Serilog in an optional Nuget package
* Methods marked [Obsolete] in the 2.x series have been removed.

## TODO before release

* Put Verbose logging throughout framework
