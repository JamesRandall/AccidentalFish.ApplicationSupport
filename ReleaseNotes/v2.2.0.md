# v2.2.0 Release Notes

## Improvements

* Blob container creation has been added to IAzureResourceManager - it's omission was a mistake
* Added filter support to Azure subscriptions
* Handlebars template syntax support added for emails. The v2.x series will default to Razor for backwards compatibility however this will switch to Handlebars in the v3.x series. Note that the Handlebars template engine will cache compiled templates until the containing process is destroyed.

## Bug Fixes

* Component factory now returns null when a component is not found
