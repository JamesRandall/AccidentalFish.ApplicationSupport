# v2.1.0 Release Notes

## New

* Added support for Ninject
* Added support for Autofac
* Added an IAzureResourceManager to AccidentalFish.ApplicationSupport.Azure that allows the supported Azure objects to be created at runtime (as opposed to via the configuration system)
* The _GetResourceCreator_ on IAsynchronousTableStorageRepository<T> has been marked obsolete and will be deprecated in the next major version. Instead use IAzureResourceManager.
* Updated the component host so that it has a default restart handler for components, see _IComponentHostRestartHandler_ for details
* Component host implementation now uses async and await
* The _Enqueue_ method on IQueue<T> now has default values of null for the success and failure actions 
* Restructured source code to reduce the number of items in the root folder

## Bug Fixes

* The _Enqueue_ method on IQueue<T> now correctly throws an exception if their is no failure action.
